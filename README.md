What is SFMLTemplate?
====

SFMLTemplate is a basic Visual Studio 2012 project configured to build a "hello world" example for SFML.  The project
is configured to pull the required files from C:\SFML-2.0 and C:\SFML-2.0-x86 for 64 bit and 32 bit builds respectively.
These values are stored, and can be easily changed, through the $(SFMLDir) variable defined on the project's property
pages using Visual Studio's property manager.
